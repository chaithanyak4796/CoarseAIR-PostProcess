CompileTrajs:
	* Reads the proc-level trajectories and PaQSol files and ensures that there were no discrepencies in the output files.
	* Generates the merged trajectories file in the required format to compute recombination statistics.
	* Will add pathways identification later.

Statistics:
	* Combines the compiled traj files from different cases and computes the recombination statistics.
